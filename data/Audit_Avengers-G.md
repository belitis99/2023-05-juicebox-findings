1) 
Using a single JBPayDelegateAllocation struct variable instead of an array with a single element could be more efficient in terms of gas usage (but only IF the array will always just have/use one single element in this scenario)

CURRENT:

		delegateAllocations = new JBPayDelegateAllocation[](1);
		delegateAllocations[0] =
    		JBPayDelegateAllocation({delegate: IJBPayDelegate(this), amount: _data.amount.value});
           
                
RECOMMENDATION (implicit return variable initialization updated too):

function payParams(JBPayParamsData calldata _data)
    external
    override
    returns (uint256 weight, string memory memo, JBPayDelegateAllocation memory delegateAllocation) /// @audit implicit initialization updated for delegateAllocation
{
    // Find the total number of tokens to mint, as a fixed point number with 18 decimals
    uint256 _tokenCount = PRBMath.mulDiv(_data.amount.value, _data.weight, 10 ** 18);

    // Unpack the quote from the pool, given by the frontend
    (,, uint256 _quote, uint256 _slippage) = abi.decode(_data.metadata, (bytes32, bytes32, uint256, uint256));

    // If the amount swapped is bigger than the lowest received when minting, use the swap pathway
    if (_tokenCount < _quote - (_quote * _slippage / SLIPPAGE_DENOMINATOR)) {
        // Pass the quote and reserve rate via a mutex
        mintedAmount = _tokenCount;
        reservedRate = _data.reservedRate;

        /// @audit Set the delegate allocation directly using a struct
        delegateAllocation = JBPayDelegateAllocation({
            delegate: IJBPayDelegate(this),
            amount: _data.amount.value
        });

        return (0, _data.memo, delegateAllocation);
    }

    // If minting, do not use this as delegate
    return (_data.weight, _data.memo, delegateAllocation);
}

## uint256 is too big for certain variables
heyy team, I hope that you are all doing well, basically uint256 is too large for certain variables like
_tokenCount and _reservedRate because they aren't inside a loop and aren't being incremented or something, the only that is somewhat close is the swapping thing but even then uint256 too huge.

Thank you have a nice day.
