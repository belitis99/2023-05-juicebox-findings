1)In the _mint function, since it is already an internal function and called within the contract, you can consider using the direct function modifier to skip the external call to the controller.mintTokensOf function. This saves gas by avoiding the overhead of an external call.

2)Consider emitting the JBXBuybackDelegate_Swap event conditionally when a swap occurs, rather than unconditionally at the end of the function. This can save gas when the swap does not take place.
