1. Inherited from [ownable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-juicebox/blob/9d0458282511ff269b3b35b5b082b56d5cc08663/juice-buyback/contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L39), but it's not used
2. [supportsInterface](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-juicebox/blob/9d0458282511ff269b3b35b5b082b56d5cc08663/juice-buyback/contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L359) should call `super.supportsInterface()` so it also returns true if called with the `interfaceId` of `ERC165` itself.

3. uniswapV3SwapCallback doesn't check if the pool is deployed by the canonical UniswapV3Factory
[Code snippet](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-juicebox/blob/9d0458282511ff269b3b35b5b082b56d5cc08663/juice-buyback/contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L216)

It's possible a malicious pool is added which can have bad consequences. Though I think it's informational since only project owners would be able to do that and there are plenty of ways to rug for them. Still it's a good practice to put the checks in places as recommended by the uniswap team. 

[See uniswap docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/callback/IUniswapV3SwapCallback)
> In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the swap. The caller of this method must be checked to be a UniswapV3Pool deployed by the canonical UniswapV3Factory. amount0Delta and amount1Delta can both be 0 
if no tokens were swapped.
