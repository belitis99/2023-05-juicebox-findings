GA1 : Failure to check the zero address in the constructor causes the contract to be deployed again

Zero address control is not performed in the constructor in the scope of the audit. Bypassing this check could cause the contract to be deployed by mistakenly entering a zero address. In this case, the contract will need to be redeployed. This means extra gas consumption as contract deployment costs are high.
