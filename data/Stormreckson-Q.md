The transfer of weth form the uniswapv3callback is not logging an event or bool, events should be emitted in case the WETH transfer succeeds or fails, respectively. The bool value returned by the transaction is checked and if it is true, the success event is emitted. If it is false, the failure event is emitted and the function reverts.
If the transaction fails for some reason (e.g. the sender does not have enough WETH), it will simply revert and the function will not return any value.
