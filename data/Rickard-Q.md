## Vulnerability details
### Impact
`.mint` wonâ€™t check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset.     
      
OpenZeppelin [recommendation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L277) is to use the safe variant of `_mint`.     
## Tools Used
Manual review
## Recommended mitigation steps
Replace `_mint()` with `_safeMint()`.
