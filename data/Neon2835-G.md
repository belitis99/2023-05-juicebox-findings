Line 312 of the `_swap` function in the contract `JBXBuybackDelegate` declares a new variable `uint256 _nonReservedTokenInContract = _amountReceived - _reservedToken;`, because there has been an operation before: `uint256 _reservedToken = _amountReceived - _nonReservedT oken; ` , the value of `_nonReservedTokenInContract` is always equal to `_nonReservedToken`, so there is no need for a new variable `_nonReservedTokenInContract`, just use the already declared `_nonReservedToken` variable, which can save some Gas consumption.
