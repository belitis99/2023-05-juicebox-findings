My general findings;
1- If we can adjust the parameters accordingly. 
2- Some functions are too long if we can shorten them it will be more readable
3- My point of view, instead of int256 we should define int128 or maybe int64
4- There were two error cases initialized in my opinion it can be defined as more
5- If we import re-entrance attacks from the Open-Zepplin library, we can guarantee to prevent re-entrance attacks
6- Main contracts could be splited to multiple contracts
