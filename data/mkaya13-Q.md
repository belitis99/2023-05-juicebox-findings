- Lines 46-47, only 2 error cases initialized, a project like this could include more errors. (I felt like that)
- Line 183 didPay function might be written with ternary operation with multiple chained ternaries.
- Lines 189 and 193, instead of using mintedAmount and reservedRate, maybe we can initialize boolean state variables and try to create the logic with them.
- Line 205 if (_amountReceived == 0) could be initialized like if(!_amountReceived) (I am not sure)
- Lines 258-326 _swap function is so long. It can be divided into multiple functions so that it can be easier to read.
- Line 269 returns parameters that might be initialized as int128 or int64 instead of int256. 
- Lines 302-309 and lines 338-345 could be initialized with modifiers (If we can adapt the parameters accordingly).
- Lines 293-299 and lines 314-321 could be initialized with modifiers (If we can adapt the parameters accordingly). 

In general
- There are no modifiers initialized in the Smart Contract.
- Open Zeppelin ReentrancyAttack modifier can be included on functions that include payments to make sure that they are safe.
