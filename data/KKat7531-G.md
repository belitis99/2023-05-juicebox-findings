[G-01]bytes constants are more efficient than string constans

If the data can fit in 32 bytes, the bytes32 data type can be used instead of bytes or strings, as it is less robust in terms of robustness.
 
147  returns (uint256 weight, string memory memo, JBPayDelegateAllocation[] memory delegateAllocations)
238  returns (uint256 reclaimAmount, string memory memo, JBRedemptionDelegateAllocation  
  
[G-02] abi.encode() is less efficient than abi.encodePacked()
268 data: abi.encode(_minimumReceivedFromSwap)   

[G-03] Use hardcode address instead address(this)
Instead of using address(this), it is more gas-efficient to pre-calculate and use the hardcoded address.
