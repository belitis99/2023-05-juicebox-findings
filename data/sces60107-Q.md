# Summary

I list 1 low-critical finding:
* (Low) Anyone can call `payParams()` to set the mutex. 

# (Low) Anyone can call `payParams()` to set the mutex. 

## Impact

Anyone can call `payParams()` to set the mutex. There is no check on `msg.sender`. The intended path is calling `payParams()` first then calling `didPay()` if needed. Usually, this issue won’t harm the protocol in the intended usage.

## Proof of Concept

There is no check on `msg.sender`. Anyone can set the mutex
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-juicebox/blob/main/juice-buyback/contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L144
```solidity
    function payParams(JBPayParamsData calldata _data)
        external
        override
        returns (uint256 weight, string memory memo, JBPayDelegateAllocation[] memory delegateAllocations)
    {
        …
        if (_tokenCount < _quote - (_quote * _slippage / SLIPPAGE_DENOMINATOR)) {
            // Pass the quote and reserve rate via a mutex
            mintedAmount = _tokenCount;
            reservedRate = _data.reservedRate;

           …
    }
```


## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check to ensure that `msg.sender == address(jbxTerminal)`
