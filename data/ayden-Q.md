1.Should check if `_amountToSend` is greater than 0.
JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L216#L233
According to uniswap v3 document:

```
In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the swap. The caller of this method must be checked to be a UniswapV3Pool deployed by the canonical UniswapV3Factory. amount0Delta and amount1Delta can both be 0 if no tokens were swapped.
We should check if the value of `_amountToSend` is greater than 0.
```

```solidity
+ if(_amountToSend == 0 ) revert Some_Error();
```

2.Should check if `_reservedRate` is greater than `JBConstants.MAX_RESERVED_RATE`
JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L278#L279
`JBConstants.MAX_RESERVED_RATE` The value of `_reservedRate` is recorded in the payParams function:

```solidity
    reservedRate = _data.reservedRate;
```

The value of `_data.reservedRate` is obtained from the recordPaymentFrom function in the file `JBSingleTokenPaymentTerminalStore3_1.sol`:

```solidity
    fundingCycle.reservedRate(),
```

The `reservedRate` function is sourced from the `JBFundingCycleMetadataResolver.sol` library:

```solidity
function reservedRate(JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle) internal pure returns (uint256) {
  return uint256(uint16(_fundingCycle.metadata >> 24));
}
```

Therefore, the maximum value of `_reservedRate` is 65535 (2^16 - 1). It is necessary to check if `_amountToSend` is greater than 0.
