Low Level Findings

[L-1]Reentrancy in JBXBuybackDelegate.didPay(JBDidPayData) (contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#183-209)
Consider doing following changes on the contract to solve problem. 
1)Add following import : import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol".
2)Change contract definition as line below.
contract JBXBuybackDelegate is IJBFundingCycleDataSource, IJBPayDelegate, IUniswapV3SwapCallback, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard
3)Change didPay function as adding NonReentrant modifier as function signature below. 
function didPay(JBDidPayData calldata _data) external payable  override nonReentrant

[L-2] Reentrancy in JBXBuybackDelegate._swap(JBDidPayData,uint256,uint256) (contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#258-326)
The reentrancy problem in _swap function will resolve too when the steps above are applied.

Non-Critical Findings 

[N-1] Unused Solidity Import
Consider removing following import at line 15 : import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol".Because even thought JBXBuybackDelegate inherits from Ownable contract. It is still never used in contract's logic. 

[N-2] Event names are not CapWords
Consider changing the following event names() JBXBuybackDelegateJBXBuybackDelegate_Mint(uint256) and JBXBuybackDelegateJBXBuybackDelegate_Swap(uint256,uint256,uint256) as  JBXBuybackDelegateJBXBuybackDelegateMint(uint256),JBXBuybackDelegateJBXBuybackDelegateSwap(uint256,uint256,uint256)
