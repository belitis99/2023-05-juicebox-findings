- L4/8 - IJBController3_1, IJBFundingCycleBallot are imported, which are not used in any way, this generates that when the interface is deployed in a blockchain and in an explorer the entire code is seen, it becomes difficult to understand the code.
In addition to the extra cost of gas that is generated.

- L185/218 - The understanding of the code could be improved if a modifier were created so that it is clear who is authorized to use the function.

modifier onlyAddress(bool) {
	if(bool == true){
		if (msg.sender != address(jbxTerminal)) revert JuiceBuyback_Unauthorized();
	}else{
		if (msg.sender != address(pool)) revert JuiceBuyback_Unauthorized();	
	}
}
