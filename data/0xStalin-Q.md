**Fix:**
- The recommendation is to use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library which provides overflow checking when casting from one type of number to another. Consider using SafeCast when casting between types to prevent overflow errors.

  - As reported by OpenZeppelin on the **[Notional Audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/notional-audit/#phase-1) ([M02] Casting between types without overflow checks)**, casting between uint to int and viceversa carries the potential of overflow errors
